Running the simulations is separated into two parts:

(1) "make_figs_" are scripts to run the simulations and save the output
(2) "plot_figs_" are scripts to plot the saved output

There are three different groups of scripts:

(a) "no_growth": we assume patterning on a static 1D domain
(b) "wavelength": assuming a static 1D domain, we explore how parameter variations affect pattern wavelength
(c) "with_growth": we incorporate a (highly simplified) model of digit growth

The folder SSB_scripts contains all the functions needed to perform the simulations.
